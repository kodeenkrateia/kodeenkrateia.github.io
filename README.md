## Hello World!

Hello!

My name is Marc Vilardell, and I'm a systems engineer with over 14 years of experience in the IT world. Throughout my career, I've faced all kinds of technical challenges: from complex configurations to bugs that seem like the work of black magic. And if there's one thing I've learned, it's that documentation is as valuable as it is scarce.

This blog was born as my personal knowledge base (KB), a place to dump what I learn day by day. Why make it public? Because I firmly believe in sharing knowledge. If anything I publish helps someone solve a problem or save time, then it's already been worth it.

Today, with AI accessible to everyone, it might seem like there's no longer a need to write these things. But those of us who work in IT know that real, specific solutions are often not just a prompt away. They're buried in forums, in forgotten logs... or in blogs like this one.

Welcome to my technical documentation, my experiments, my learnings, and surely a few other topics that have nothing to do with anything stated before. 

If it helps you, mission accomplished.
